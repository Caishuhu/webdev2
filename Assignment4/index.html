     <pre>
        <p class="part">
        I measure every Grief I meet
        With narrow, probing, eyes -
        I wonder if It weighs like Mine -
        Or has an Easier size.</p>
       <pre> <p class="part"> 
        wonder if They bore it long -
        Or did it just begin -
        I could not tell the Date of Mine -
        It feels so old a pain - </p>
       <p class="part"> 
        I wonder if it hurts to live -
        And if They have to try -
        And whether - could They choose between -
        It would not be - to die -</p>
       <p class="part"> 
        I note that Some - gone patient long -
        At length, renew their smile -
        An imitation of a Light
        That has so little Oil -</p>
        <p class="part">
        I wonder if when Years have piled -
        Some Thousands - on the Harm -
        That hurt them early - such a lapse
        Could give them any Balm -</p>
        <p class="part">
        Or would they go on aching still
        Through Centuries of Nerve -
        Enlightened to a larger Pain -
        In Contrast with the Love -</p>
        <p class="part">
        The Grieved - are many - I am told -
        There is the various Cause -
        Death - is but one - and comes but once -
        And only nails the eyes -</p>
        <p class="part">
        There's Grief of Want - and grief of Cold -
        A sort they call "Despair" -
        There's Banishment from native Eyes -
        In sight of Native Air -</p>
        <p class="part"> 
        though I may not guess the kind -
        Correctly - yet to me
        A piercing Comfort it affords
        In passing Calvary -</p>
        <p class="part">
        To note the fashions - of the Cross -
        And how they're mostly worn -
        Still fascinated to presume
        That Some - are like my own -</p>
