       <h3>Beginning </h3>
       <p> At the beginning of this, I want to talk about web concepts. I do not have many experiences and knowing on web development, so my perspective probably will be a little bit stuffless.</p>
       <p> From the course of Web development1, I have learned some basic elements and concepts of web. It is like another kind of creating for me, which is different with the traditional art design. The difference is web language is the pencil of web creators. Web is more about logical and responsive, and like a mysterious internet chain.

      <section id="Openness">
        <h3>Openness</h3>
        <p>From the article of Viget, there have mentioned the principles of openness and <a href=" https://www.yearofopen.org/november-open-perspective-what-is-open-web/what-is-the-open-web-and-why-is-it-important-submitted-by-mark-surman-executive-director-of-the-mozilla-foundation/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COpen%20web%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20sweeping%20term%20%E2%80%94%20it,all%20its%20users%2C%20not%20select%20gatekeepers%20or%20governments">Open Web</a> (“Open web” is a sweeping term — it encompasses technical concepts like open-source code and open standards. It also encompasses democratic concepts like free expression and digital inclusion). </p>
        <p>Therefore, I think “openness” is critical to the web environment. It is also the original founder’s persistence and principle of their network create. </p>
        <p>
          If we compare the open web to a global public resource, like clean water or the environment. Then it is becoming to something we all depend on, and be polluted: by harassment and abuse, by misinformation, by bad public policy. So, the open web needs care. 
          </p>
         <p>Same concept with the role of web authors, who need enough open web spaces to do more innovate and inclusive products, which are also critical to the web development in society or business.</p>

      <section id="Current Situation">
        <h3>Current Situation</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.london.ac.uk/news-opinion/london-connection/feature/digital-dominance-rise-google-facebook">Dominance of Google and Facebook</a></p>
        <p>With the huge growth of mobile, Facebook and google have become a tremendous asset for businesses and political campaigns, allowing them to target users in ways previously unimagined. Of course, capital has also benefited enormously. Unavoidable, there have some potential or exact problems are come in. </p>
        <p>
          If they only pursue the capital and benefits, there is bound to be a monopoly effect, and a convergence with the market. Also, the competition of market will decline. 
          </p>
        <p>However, there are many <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/top-internet-browsers-4589106">good web browsers</a> in recent years. For example, Firebox, Duckduckgo, Microsoft Edge and Safari.</p>

      </section>
      
      <section id="Missing and Going">
        <h3>Missing and Going</h3>
        <p>For the missing, I want to say a flooded or monotonous marketplace mean marketers need to increase their pace of innovation. And the Market convergence is obviously appeared, not only will makes web authors will have less opportunities to do creative products, but also makes the web directions turning to be weird or depressed in society and business.  </p>
        <p>For the going, it is critical that the influence these giants have on the web’s future. But the existence of these giants is not to make us fear to compete or develop, it should be contributed us move forward and do more good thing.
          Be activism and optimism, just like Lee said, “It has taken all of us to build the web we have, and now it is up to all of us to build the web we want – for everyone.”
