    <h1>Talk with Xinmin</h1>

    <h3>Min is a graduate student in rail communications and lives in China. She was a bit of an introvert and spoke softly at all times. In this interview, we talk about her past, present and thoughts. </h3>

<aside class="side1"><h4>“It is hard to keep present, but also to change hugely.” </h4> </aside>


<p> <b> What do you think of your personality? And why?</b></p>

<p><strong>P</strong>resumably, we rarely talk about very formal and serious matters, so she had no idea where to start with this one. Then, she said, “It is hard to keep present, but also to change hugely.” From the past to the present, she has become steadier and gentler, less susceptible to the influence of circumstances. She told me that she used to speak freely without much consideration or if it hurt someone, but now she does.  She felt that there was more, morally or realistically, to be considered as an adult. 
    Before college, for example, she was more sensitive. This was because her relationship with her friends was not good at the time. She prefers to like the state she's in now, more confident and calmer about solving problems.

        I know you've been taking a few music classes, but you had to give them up before you went to college. How do you feel about that?
    </b></p>

    <p><strong> "H</strong>onestly, I could be more positive about talking about this now. It is normal that I felt frustrated and unacceptable to make an important decision since I am informed to give up music and study railway in the college which was already arranged by my parents.” " She said in a quiet tone.  Moreover, there was a reason why she did not think herself capable of continuing in the musical life. She felt it was also an opportunity to reflect on her own life and find her own direction. So, since going to college, she's tried to take it all in, worked hard and made a lot of friends.

<section class="content3">
    <p><b>For now, do you have any plans for the future?</b></p>


<p><strong> S</strong>he said, “I just want to live my life and be happy.” She told me about her plans to work, travel with friends, and live for now. Particularly, life turns to more meaningful and important for people after Covid. Based on the condition of this society, the intense competition from everywhere, she just wishes to follow her own pace, and work on what she like and needed.
