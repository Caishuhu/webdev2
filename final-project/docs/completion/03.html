    <h1>Talk with Hongliang</h1>

    <h3>Hongliang is my grandfather, who turns 75 this year, and he's had a lot of tough, happy times through the years. He always played the part of the man who knew so many interesting stories and could fix so many things, like the mechanic in our family.  </h3>

<p><b>If you could pick one word to describe yourself, what would it be?</b></p>

<p><strong>S</strong>traight forward, I would say. I prefer to think of it as a natural personality, like someone who is gentle, someone who is ebullient, someone who is reserved. Experience has an effect on the process of forming one's own personality, but nature is also important, and cannot be rejected or removed. And for my part, I do think I am a straightforward person, and do not like intricacy, especially as honesty is a vital principle to me.

     <p><b>How have you coped with the tough times over the years?
     </b></p>

    <p><strong> T</strong>here is so much, whatever it is, that has happened that it is hard to predict what will happen in the future.
        I can give an example through the construction of our house, which was sort of a struggle for me during that time. Depending on the circumstances, to build a house you need to have a hundred thousand ready, but I only have fifty thousand, which means I have to think about how to get another fifty thousand. Then I would analyse whether I could earn the money or borrow it from a relative, just trying many ways of dealing with this and always finding the 'answer'.
         In a word, the actual situation and one's own ability were to me the most important factors in considering the difficulty.

    <aside class="side2"><h4> 'three days are appointed, and seven points are gained by fighting' 
    </h4></aside>
    <p><b>  How do you feel about yourself in your life? Do you feel satisfied with the present?
        </b></p>


<p><strong> I</strong> am content with my life now and enjoy it.  Particularly, I think it's a result of the hard work I've put in over the decades, so I do feel very fulfilled in my current life. And my kids have their own lives and jobs. I have nothing else to worry about.
    And I believe that 'three days are appointed, and seven points are gained by fighting,' so I did try to get a better life when I was young, and now I can take a break.
