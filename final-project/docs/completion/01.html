<aside class="side1"><h4>“Be responsible of your stuff and time.”</h4> </aside>


<p>We had this talk in remote, I could not wait to threw out the conversation, <b> "It was very incredible that you do illustration, printing, graphic design, part-time job and many things. How do you juggle it all? "</b></p>

<p><strong>W</strong>hen we talked about this, she obviously didn’t have any preparations. So, she told me from the start, “I don’t know how to manage time. So far, I still struggling with balance my school, social and personal life.” Since Covid happened, students must do online classes which is a hard time to her. Especially, after she experienced a worse relationship and came to American in the beginning, she felt so insecurity and fear to socialize. 
    After that terrible term, everything seems like back to right way, College makes she realized that “Be responsible of your stuff and time.” She says, “Before the teachers always tell you this, tell you that, give you instructions and stand behind you all the time. But it is completely different thing at college. Nobody will come to tell you do anything unless you go on your own, the teachers often keep telling you are good, your works are good.” Also, the language is another aspect that makes her fear to socialize and speaking for a little bit while. 
    Because of above of all, she just starts to try to manage her time from the third semester at college, socialize more new friends with different nationality and religions, quit her part-time job to spare more time for her art products.

<p><strong> S</strong>he said with no doubt, “Art.” Since she has her family’s support, she could do a lot of interesting things she likes. Particularly, she cared how to settle art style of her during that time. “I am not do art for job.” She says. There are many people do not think being an artist is a good thing, “poor” always is surrounded with “artist” all the time.
