        <h3>INTRO</h3>

        <p>My topic would be How one’s experience affect one’s personality. Because this is one of the things always confuse me, just as sometimes people want to do some changes on own’s personality, habits, or relationships, but some of people don’t like to do any changes to their life, the only thing they want to do is maintain the current situation. </p>

        


        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Also, one’s experience have a lot of impacts on one’s actions and thinking. Just as same as Emily Dickinson who is a mid-century female poet, she was pursuing live in seclusion until died. She doesn’t care fame or be a nobody, enjoys the interesting of creating verses, even though at that the dark times were not kind to female writers. 
            In the meantime, words power also is a part of what I want to explore, I believe there are potential power in the words no matter what forms they are. From the verses of Emily Dickinson, her verses are stunning and powerful, but in that era, she didn’t have more support, even get education.
            And for the interviews I will start from the different generations and eras, people have formed diverse personality, such as introvert, extrovert and ambivert, etc. And I’m curious about how people formed their personality, what will change in their life, and what they will do.  </p>
            
            
            
           <p> Interviewer 01---Ariadna Soto
            She is one of my friends from Mexico, who has an Illustration major. She is a very enthusiastic and socializing person, and loves everything about art. And she lives a very multiple family those different religions so that her mindset is very enthusiasm and supportive. </p>
             
        
           <p> Interviewer 02---Xinmin   
            She is also one of my friends from China, who has a Digital Media major. She is a quiet and organized people and enjoys readings, audios, social media. Usually, she likes staying chill environment and organizing everything. </p>
             
            <p>Interviewer 03---Hongliang Hu 
            My grandpa has a variety of interesting experiences of his life, from 1948-2023. He is a very respectable and reliable person in my mind. But after years I grew up, he seems like not so perfect as usual, just as people all have the vulnerable side. I’m very expected to know what his thinking about his experiences and cultural impacts from his view is. </p>
            
            
            <p>Overall, I want to learn from this topic is through the connections between experiences and personality to explore more sides of life.  Particularly, as a major of Interaction design student, it is one of the necessary parts to know and access to my “audience” and be more open-minded and comprehensive. Whereas, there also have a most common phenomenon is the occupation’s choice of people always have many very complicated factors, which is the most intuitive things to demonstrate my topic.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p> We are 'strangers' and 'acquaintances', those definitions are bonded everywhere in our daily life. 
            <p>The experience of past is what we know now, but the future is coming wait for us to explore and maybe we will change or keep present. However we will see until we experienced.  </p>
       

            <div class="content2">
                <p>    So far, I have got some thoughts from my topic ‘how one’s experience affects one’s personality’. It's hard to focus on a single sentence to describe and conclude, now that the project is nearly complete. At the beginning of this project, I was curious about how people form their personalities, how their lives would change, and what they would do about those changes. So I did something to find out, and then realized how hard it is to understand a person, especially a 'stranger'. </p>
                
                
                
               <p>     I interviewed three interviewees for my topic, a process that was not as easy as I expected, but I learned something along the way. That's the easiest way I can get to know them. How they speak and act is quite different between my interviewees. One of them was telling herself passionately, one was whispering softly, one was experienced and decisive. They have completely different communities, cultures and countries, but the same quality of working to build their lives separately. When talking about their experiences, they talk about what they struggled with and how they felt from the past to the present. It is pleasing to note that they all have at certain points a marked growth, drawing lessons and ideas from all these past periods, for better or for worse. Also, it's not hard for me to see the difference between young and old, just by looking at age. I know that most Chinese old people have gone through a lot of hard times in the past, so it is best for them that their children have a happy life and their own life without worrying about food or clothing. Because of this, sometimes there is nothing to aspire to in the lives of older people, and even some genuine hobbies are hard to see unless they survive. So, at that moment, I was frustrated about how to get them to start living their lives and pursuing what they really like. </p>
                 
            
               <p>    And for the young people, I was able to have an intense relationship with them during interviews. The struggle is so stark that it is powerless to change. People like to talk about the 'original family,' which is always a perfect excuse for everyone to put any fault they have on it. Sometimes, it is true, the parts of us are formed by influences from the original home, such as personality, a sense of value, and a view of right and wrong, but these influences are not unchangeable. So, that's what my subject is trying to figure out, the effects of experience from the past to the present. I know this could be a huge part of the discussion, but just focus on the small circle - the family for this project. This is also a very controversial topic. The 'family' is usually at certain points somewhat familiar and unfamiliar to us. However, it will be in two cases. People want to discuss their families, or someone resists talking about delicate subjects. </p>
                 
                <p>In the final stages of this project, there were many steps and details I had to consider regarding the design of the website, such as how to pick colors that expressed the characteristics of my topic, and how to give a clear and unique layout that could be an emotional content for my topic. </p>
