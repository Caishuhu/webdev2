  <p > It's been a long time since I've been confused and hurt by other people's words, especially from those close to me. I fell into a circle of emotional strangeness, became sensitive and lacked confidence. Sometimes it's easy to overlook the impact of words, not least because we've become more apathetic since the advent of social media. But we are not wood or stone, we are human beings with natural feelings. </p>

    <p >So, my project will be in the form of a short black-and-white video that explores the connection between what we others say and what we feel through a lot of use of words with effects.  I tried some motion in After Effects and a cover in Photoshop. These motions make a scene for us to break, these fragments of your inner soul. With these usages, the words become more vivid and more visual fragmentation is added. I want the media to mirror the chaotic and destructive feelings that we have when others speak these violet words to us.</p>
